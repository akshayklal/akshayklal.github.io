Hello! My name is Akshay and I am currently attending San Mateo High school in the San Francisco Bay Area.
I have a deep passion for analyzing data and uncovering insights that can be shared with others.
Through this blog, I will explore a variety of topics and hobbies, from climate change and elections to
astronomy and sports, all through a data driven lense.
Thanks for reading!
