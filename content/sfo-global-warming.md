This graph shows the increase of the average min and max
temperatures at San Francisco Airport since 1946. Average
min and max temperatures have increased by around 3 °F
over last 70 years. This data clearly shows that global
warming trends are present in the San Francisco Bay Area.

It is interesting to see that the average annual minimum temperature
has been consistently over 50 °F for the last ten years, however from
1946 to 1956 the average annual minimum temperature never went above
50 °F. The average annual minimum temperature has been increasing
by 0.06 °F per year (the slope of the trend line in the graph). If
this trend continues, then in 100 years, the average annual minimum
temperature would increase by 6 °F. 

In order to generate this graph, I first downloaded temperature
data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) webservice. Then, for each year, I calculated the annual
average maximum and minimum temperatures. Finally, I graphed the
data to show the average annual temperature trends at San Francisco
Airport (SFO).

I used a python program (using requests, numpy, panda, and matplotlib 
libraries) to download, aggregate, and graph the data.
